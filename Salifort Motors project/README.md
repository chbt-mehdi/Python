# Employee Retention Project at Salifort Motors

## Project Overview
The HR department at Salifort Motors is looking to improve employee satisfaction levels within the company. They have collected data from employees and are seeking data-driven suggestions to understand what factors might lead an employee to leave the company.

The goal of this project is to analyze the collected data and build a model that predicts whether an employee will leave the company. By predicting employees likely to quit, we can identify contributing factors and take proactive measures to increase employee retention, which is beneficial considering the time and expense involved in hiring new employees.

## Conclusion and Recommendations
Our analysis, based on a machine learning model and feature importance extracted from the model, indicates that a variety of factors are contributing to the companyâ€™s attrition rate, with high workload levels being a significant factor.

Based on our findings, we propose the following recommendations to the stakeholders:

- **Compensate Overworked Employees:** Implement a reward system for employees who work long hours. This could be in the form of financial compensation or by ensuring they are not required to consistently work beyond their contracted hours.
- **Recognize Employee Efforts:** Acknowledge and reward employees for their hard work and dedication. This could be through public recognition, bonuses, or other incentives. Regular performance reviews can also help employees understand their strengths and areas for improvement.
- **Balance Promotion Rates:** Ensure fair and transparent promotion policies across all departments. If certain departments have lower promotion rates, investigate the reasons and take corrective action. This will prevent employees from feeling undervalued or abandoned.
- **Establish Clear Promotion Criteria:** Create clear and transparent promotion criteria to ensure that employees understand the expectations for advancement.
- **Promote Long-Tenured Employees:** Consider promoting employees who have been with the company for at least four years. Alternatively, conduct further investigation into why employees with four years of tenure are dissatisfied.
- **Limit Project Load:** Cap the number of projects that employees can work on. The optimal number is 3 to 4.
- **Prioritize Tasks and Set Realistic Deadlines:** Ensure that employees are not overburdened with unrealistic expectations.
- **Enhance Recognition and Evaluation:** Implement a system that recognizes and rewards employee contributions. This could include regular feedback and performance evaluations, highlighting their achievements, and offering constructive criticism when necessary.
- **Conduct Exit Interviews:** Gather feedback from departing employees to gain insights into the reasons for their departure. This feedback can be used to identify areas for improvement and address common issues that contribute to attrition.
