# Python Project: Roller Coaster Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This repository contains Python scripts for conducting an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a Roller Coaster dataset.

## Project Description

The goal of this project is to delve into the dataset and answer the following questions:

1. **Which locations have the fastest roller coasters (considering a minimum of 10 roller coasters per location)?** 
2. **What materials are most commonly used in roller coaster construction?**
3. **What is the oldest roller coaster that is currently in operation, and how many years has it been operational?**

## Files / Folders
- `archive (1).zip`: This folder contains the dataset in CSV format.
- `my_data.csv`: This is the main dataset used for the analysis.
- `Eda.ipynb`: This Jupyter notebook contains the Python code used for the EDA. It includes sections for data cleaning, data visualization, and data analysis.

## Usage

To run the EDA script, you need to have Jupyter Notebook installed. You can then clone this repository and open `Eda.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook.
