## Models Used
- Logistic Regression
- K-Nearest Neighbors
- Support Vector Machine
- Decision Tree
- Random Forest

## Files in the Repository
- `heart_attack_pred.ipynb`: Jupyter notebook containing the analysis and model building.
- `heart.csv`: Dataset used for training and testing the models.

## How to Run
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required dependencies.
3. Run the `heart_attack_pred.ipynb` notebook in Jupyter.
